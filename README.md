Advanced JS - constructor-hangman

Technologies used: Advanced JS (Constructors & Methods) | Node.js

Created a command-line application using advanced JS concepts. 

Here's how the hangman game works: 

	* Run the application in command line using node

	* The app will display the hangman image, a hint word, and 6 chances to guess the word 

	* If you guess the word correctly within 6 guesses, then the command line will display win! 

    * If you guess the word incorrectly within 6 guesses, then the command line will display game over. 

	* If you guess a correct letter, then the command line will display correct!

	* If you guess an incorrect letter, then the command line will display nope! 

	* To restart the game run node app.js

Enjoy!
